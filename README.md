### Greetings!
I am a 21 y.o. student and I am on the path to becoming a software engineer. Currently I dive into backend development and have some interesting projects:
[![Backend](https://github.com/Terekhov-Nikita/Hotel-it-back)]
[![Frontend](https://github.com/Terekhov-Nikita/Hotel-it-front)]
[![Telegram Bot](https://github.com/Terekhov-Nikita/TelegramBot)]

- My hard skills: Java core, JavaScript basics, little experience with Angular and TypeScript. I Confidently use Linux (ssh, bash, vim) and write basic PostgreSQL queries.
- Tools I use: Intellij IDEA, WebStorm git, mvn, insomnia/postman
